Simple format course for Moodle is a very visual course format aimed to 
primary school students, but can be used for other purposes.

It's a third party course format designed  by the Government of
Andorra [1] and developed and maintained by UPCnet [2]. The main purpose
is to bring closer the learning environment EDUC& [3] to the youngest
students.

This course format was ported to Àgora [4] and improved by the
Departament d'Ensenyament de la Generalitat de Catalunya [5].
